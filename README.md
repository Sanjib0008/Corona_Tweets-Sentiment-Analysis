## Corona Tweets Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Twitter data related to the COVID-19 pandemic, using machine learning techniques to classify the sentiment of tweets. The goal is to understand public sentiment during the pandemic by classifying tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The project uses Python for data processing, analysis, and model training, and leverages libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of tweets mentioning keywords related to COVID-19. Each tweet includes features such as text content, timestamp, and potentially metadata like user information. This dataset is used to train and test machine learning models for sentiment classification.

## Key Features

1. Data Cleaning: Preprocessing of text data, including tokenization, removing stop words, and handling missing values.

2. Sentiment Classification: Classification of tweets into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral).
   
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluation of multiple machine learning models to identify the most accurate classifier.
   
## Technologies Used

Python: Main programming language

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

Seaborn: Data visualization

scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation

## Getting Started

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: Install using pip

## Model Training & Evaluation 

The notebook explores several machine learning algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Trees

## Results
   
Sentiment Distribution:
Visualize the percentage of tweets that are positive, negative, or neutral using bar charts or pie charts to show the public sentiment distribution.

## Time-based Trends

Examine how sentiments evolved over time, identifying peaks in positive or negative sentiments correlated with specific events (e.g., vaccine announcements, lockdowns).
Location-based Sentiment: If location data is available, analyze sentiment distribution across different regions to understand localized reactions to the pandemic.

## Insights
   
Public Perception:

Identify general public sentiments (e.g., fear, frustration, or optimism) and how these shifted with different pandemic phases.

## Key Concerns:

Use word clouds or key phrases in negative/positive tweets to reveal recurring topics, such as concerns about health, vaccines, lockdowns, or mental health.
Misinformation Trends: Potential spikes in negative sentiment may align with misinformation or conspiracy theories circulating on social media.
