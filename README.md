# Corona_Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis
1. Objective
To analyze public sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic by studying tweets containing keywords related to COVID-19.
To understand the public's emotional response to the pandemic, which can aid government agencies, health organizations, and media in assessing public concerns and addressing misinformation.
2. Data Collection
The dataset, typically sourced from platforms like Twitter, contains tweets related to COVID-19.
Each tweet includes details such as tweet text, timestamp, user information, location (if available), and a sentiment label (like Positive, Negative, Neutral).
Data was preprocessed to remove noise (stop words, punctuation, special characters, and URLs) for better accuracy in sentiment classification.
3. Preprocessing Steps
Tokenization: Splitting tweets into individual words or tokens.
Stop Word Removal: Removing commonly used words (like "the", "is") that do not convey sentiment.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form to capture essential meaning (e.g., "running" to "run").
Vectorization: Converting text into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorization for input into machine learning models.
4. Sentiment Analysis Approach
Sentiment Labels: The dataset may include pre-labeled sentiments, typically categorized as Positive, Negative, and Neutral, or generated using models like TextBlob or VADER if not pre-labeled.
Machine Learning Models: Models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees to classify sentiment based on tweet content.
Evaluation: Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the best model for sentiment classification.
5. Results
Sentiment Distribution: Visualize the percentage of tweets that are positive, negative, or neutral using bar charts or pie charts to show the public sentiment distribution.
Time-based Trends: Examine how sentiments evolved over time, identifying peaks in positive or negative sentiments correlated with specific events (e.g., vaccine announcements, lockdowns).
Location-based Sentiment: If location data is available, analyze sentiment distribution across different regions to understand localized reactions to the pandemic.
6. Insights
Public Perception: Identify general public sentiments (e.g., fear, frustration, or optimism) and how these shifted with different pandemic phases.
Key Concerns: Use word clouds or key phrases in negative/positive tweets to reveal recurring topics, such as concerns about health, vaccines, lockdowns, or mental health.
Misinformation Trends: Potential spikes in negative sentiment may align with misinformation or conspiracy theories circulating on social media.
